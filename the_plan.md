# Study Plan

1. We started trying to break down the UC problems
    - Mathematical Physics
    - Mechanics
    - Electromagnetism
    - SKIP Electronics
    - SKIP Optics
    - Quantum Mechanics
    - Thermodynamics
    - Statistical Physics
    - SKIP Atomic Physics
    - SKIP Solid State
    - SKIP Atomic Physics
    - SKIP For The Experimentalist

    There were far too many of these to properly go over, but pick a couple each week and see what you can do.

    Instead, we should have started with A Guide to Physics Problems, but oh well.

2. Go Over Past Exams

    We'll try to do one every day.

    Start from the bottom and go up.

    Note: pre-2020 had more questions but same length per question.

    We'll try to simulate the two 2.25h halves by taking a subset of questions.
