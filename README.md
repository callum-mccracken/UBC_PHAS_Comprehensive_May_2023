-----------------------------------------

## Study Sessions:

Weekly for a bit, then daily as the exam approaches.

See [scheduling](https://github.com/callum-mccracken/UBC_PHAS_Comprehensive_May_2023/blob/master/scheduling.md).

Here's the [overall plan](https://github.com/callum-mccracken/UBC_PHAS_Comprehensive_May_2023/blob/master/the_plan.md) of what we'll study

## Study Materials:

This list is taken from the UBC site, see one of us in person for copies.
. What we should have 

1. Quantum mechanics:
    - Modern Quantum Mechanics, J.J. Sakurai
    - Quantum Physics, Stephen Gasiorowicz
2. Electromagnetism:
    - Classical Electrodynamics, J. D. Jackson
    - Introduction to Electrodynamics, David J. Griffiths
3. Thermodynamics:

    - Thermal Physics, Charles Kittel and Herbert Kroemer
4. Mechanics:
    - Classical Mechanics, Herbert Goldstein
    - Mechanics Volume 1 (Course of Theoretical Physics), L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz
5. General:
    - University of Chicago Graduate Problems in Physics with Solutions, Jeremiah A. Cronin et. al (Paperback) inexpensive and available online.

Not in UBC's site but recommended:
- A Guide to Physics Problems. part 1 and 2, Cahn & Nadgorny, has way better solutions than UC grad problems.

## Example Exams
